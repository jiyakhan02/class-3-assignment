        QUAID E AZAM ROLE IN PAKISTAN MOVEMENT
      </h1>
      <br />

      <p>
        Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnahâ€™s role in the Pakistan Movement was
        central and indispensable. He transformed the Muslim League into a
        formidable political force, articulated the need for a separate Muslim
        state through the Two-Nation Theory, and led the political struggle that
        culminated in the creation of Pakistan. His leadership, vision, and
        diplomacy turned the dream of an independent Muslim homeland into a
        reality. Jinnah remains a symbol of determination, leadership, and the
        power of political conviction in the face of immense challenges.
